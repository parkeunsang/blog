### Study log
The most important reason is that I want to record 'study log'. When I studied or did programming, I frequently refered my past code or study result. But it was hard to find proper things because they **wasn't organized**. So I decided to summary my study log on my blog.

### Data analysis
I did many data analysis toy projects but they weren't clear, didn't have sepecific descriptions because other people couldn't see them. So I will organize them and upload on my blog.

### Contents
1. Statistical learning
2. Analysis contents
